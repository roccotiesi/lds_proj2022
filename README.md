# Laboratory of Data Science | Project AY 2022-23

In this project we complete a series of assignments focused on a Business Informatics process. In the first phase, we utilized Python to process a dataset provided in CSV format and populate a SQL database without the use of additional libraries. In the second part, we solved problems using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). The final stage entailed constructing a datacube based on the database and answering business questions using MultiDimensional eXpression (MDX) in SQL management studio. We also used Power BI to develop a dashboard for displaying data distributions.
